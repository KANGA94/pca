``pca`` is a python package to perform *Principal Component Analysis* and to create insightful *plots*. The core of PCA is build on **sklearn** functionality to find maximum compatibility when combining with other packages. But this package can do a lot more. Besides the regular **Principal Components**, it can also perform **SparsePCA**, **TruncatedSVD**, and provide you with the information that can be extracted from the components. 

Functionalities of PCA are:

	* Biplot to plot the loadings
	* Determine the explained variance
	* Extract the best performing features
	* Scatter plot with the loadings
	* Outlier detection using Hotelling T2 and/or SPE/Dmodx
